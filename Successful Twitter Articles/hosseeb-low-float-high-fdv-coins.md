## Format

Long-form X article (11-minute read). The tweet contains only the article link — no caption. The piece is a systematic analysis that became central to a major industry debate, alongside Cobie's Substack article on the same topic.

## Core Thesis

Recent Binance-listed tokens with low circulating supply and high fully diluted valuations are underperforming — but not for the reasons most people think. After systematically evaluating and rejecting three popular theories, Qureshi argues the real culprit was a geopolitical risk repricing triggered by Middle East tensions in April 2024.

## Structure Breakdown

The article follows a **mystery → hypothesis testing → surprising conclusion → recommendations** structure:

1. **The observation** — Recent Binance listings are all down bad
2. **Theory 1: VC dumping** — Evaluated and rejected
3. **Theory 2: Retail rotation to memecoins** — Evaluated and rejected
4. **Theory 3: Insufficient price discovery** — Evaluated and rejected
5. **The real answer** — Geopolitical risk repricing (Iran-Israel tensions in April)
6. **The mechanism** — These tokens got "mentally basketed as risky coins" and appetite for the entire basket declined
7. **Recommendations** — For exchanges, project teams, and VCs

## Key Arguments

### What People Got Wrong

**Theory 1: VCs are dumping.** Qureshi provides evidence that VC tokens are still locked. The timeline doesn't match — most of these tokens haven't hit their unlock dates yet.

**Theory 2: Retail rotated to memecoins.** While memecoins are popular, the rotation narrative doesn't explain why these specific tokens declined in a correlated manner at a specific point in time.

**Theory 3: Not enough supply for price discovery.** Low float makes price discovery harder, but this doesn't explain the sudden and synchronized decline.

### The Actual Cause
These tokens were trading roughly flat after listing until mid-April, when Iran-Israel tensions escalated. The entire "risky new token" basket got repriced downward. The key insight: "these new projects have all been mentally basketed as risky coins" — it's a category-level repricing, not individual project failures.

### Recommendations

**For exchanges:**
- List tokens at lower prices
- Consider pricing based on public auctions rather than last VC round
- Don't list tokens without determining lock-up periods
- Show retail investors unlocking schedules and FDV data clearly

**For project teams:**
- Issue more tokens on day one (below 10% circulation is too low)
- Design healthy airdrop plans
- Don't fear a low FDV at launch — gradual price increases build better communities

**For the market:**
- The free market will eventually force valuations back into balance
- No single solution exists — market forces will push for lower FDVs over time

## Why It Works

- **The "rejected theories" structure is compelling** — Testing and dismissing three popular explanations before revealing the real answer creates a satisfying intellectual journey. Each rejected theory makes the reader more curious about what the actual answer is.
- **Contrarian without being contrarian for its own sake** — He's not just saying "everyone is wrong." He evaluates each theory on its merits with evidence, then offers a more nuanced explanation. This is earned contrarianism.
- **The "mental basket" insight is the gem** — "These new projects have all been mentally basketed as risky coins" is the kind of one-line insight that reframes how people think about the market. It shifts the analysis from individual tokens to category-level behavior.
- **Actionable recommendations for multiple audiences** — Separating advice for exchanges, teams, and VCs shows the author understands the problem from multiple angles. Each stakeholder gets something specific.
- **Bookmark-to-like ratio is very strong** — 915 bookmarks on 1,060 likes (0.86x). People are saving this as a reference for understanding token market dynamics.
- **Timing was perfect** — Published during peak debate about low float/high FDV tokens. The article entered an active conversation rather than starting one from scratch.
- **Credibility of the author** — Haseeb Qureshi as Dragonfly's managing partner is a VC writing about VC-related criticism. This insider perspective adds weight (and controversy), driving engagement.

## Takeaways for Writing

- The "test and reject popular theories" structure creates narrative tension — readers stay to see what survives
- Rejecting obvious explanations before revealing a non-obvious one makes your conclusion feel more credible
- One memorable phrase ("mentally basketed as risky coins") can become the takeaway that gets quoted everywhere
- Writing from an insider position on a controversial topic (VC writing about VC criticism) generates engagement from both supporters and critics
- Separating recommendations by audience (exchanges / teams / VCs) makes a long piece actionable for different readers
- Entering an active debate (Cobie's article was already circulating) gives your piece a built-in audience
- Even a contrarian conclusion should acknowledge that the popular theories have some merit — total dismissal feels defensive
