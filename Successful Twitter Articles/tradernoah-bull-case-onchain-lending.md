## Format

Long-form X article. The tweet itself is minimal — just a link to the embedded article with a preview image. The article carries the argument.

**Preview text:** "We will see the necessary product improvements in on-chain lending to better cater to scalable capital."

## Core Thesis

Despite current token price declines and low lending rates, fundamental improvements in on-chain lending infrastructure will drive sustainable growth in borrowing demand. Current low rates are temporary — product improvements will unlock the next cycle.

## Structure Breakdown

The article follows an **industry analysis → problem diagnosis → catalysts → valuation** structure:

1. **Framework** — The four-phase lending cycle
2. **Current state** — What's broken right now
3. **Three catalysts** — What will fix it
4. **Valuation** — Why the market is mispricing it

## Key Arguments

### The Four-Phase Lending Cycle
On-chain lending follows predictable patterns:
- Low capital/rates → rising rates attract capital → excess capital reduces rates → capital exits

This cycle repeats, and understanding where you are in it is the thesis.

### Current Problems
- "Lack of borrow demand" and "protocol induced capital inefficiency"
- Stablecoin lending rates have fallen below the risk-free SOFR rate
- This creates an unsustainable equilibrium that must resolve

### Three Catalysts for Recovery

**1. Better Collateral**
Securities lending (a multi-trillion dollar traditional market) is emerging on-chain through platforms like Kamino and Aave. New collateral types unlock new borrowing demand.

**2. Protocol Improvements**
Enhanced loan flexibility — fixed terms, whitelisting, custodian agreements — expands borrower options and induces demand from institutional players.

**3. Tokenized Yield Products**
Credit products offering 8-15% returns help crypto yield funds justify their existence while maintaining risk-adjusted returns.

### Valuation Perspective
Current lending protocol P/S multiples (21-42x) are compressing toward traditional fintech levels (8.4x), potentially creating investment opportunities in 2026.

## Why It Works

- **Contrarian timing** — Making a bull case when sentiment is low signals conviction and attracts attention from serious readers
- **Clear framework** — The four-phase cycle gives readers a mental model to anchor the argument
- **Specific numbers** — SOFR rate comparisons, P/S multiples (21-42x vs 8.4x), yield ranges (8-15%) build credibility
- **Catalysts, not hope** — The bull case isn't "number go up" — it's tied to specific product improvements that are already happening
- **Investment lens** — Framing it as a valuation opportunity gives readers something actionable
- **High bookmark ratio** — 266 bookmarks on 227 likes signals people saving this for reference, a strong indicator of depth and value

## Takeaways for Writing

- Contrarian theses ("here's the bull case when everyone is bearish") are inherently engaging
- A cyclical framework makes your argument feel inevitable rather than speculative
- Comparing on-chain metrics to traditional finance equivalents (SOFR, fintech P/S multiples) bridges credibility gaps
- High bookmark-to-like ratio is a quality signal — aim for content people want to save, not just heart
- Minimal tweet text works when the article preview (title + image) is strong enough to click
