## Format

Long-form X article. The tweet contains only the article link — no caption. The title itself ("Random end of year shower musings...") is deliberately casual, contrasting with the depth of the piece.

## Core Thesis

2025 made one thing clear: stablecoins are here to stay and stablecoin rails are the foundation of how one builds a financial services company in the next decade. But most teams are still running the 2015 fintech playbook on new rails — the real opportunity is in what stablecoin infrastructure makes possible for the first time.

## Structure Breakdown

The article follows a **state of the market → what's working → what's missing → what comes next** structure:

1. **Market growth** — The numbers that prove stablecoins have arrived
2. **Current landscape** — What's being built today (fintech on new rails)
3. **Self-custody and trust models** — Why the risk model is fundamentally different
4. **Gaps and challenges** — Security, privacy, purpose-built chains
5. **The bigger opportunity** — Programmable money, agents, new financial primitives

## Key Arguments

### The Growth Story
- Stablecoin market cap crossed $300B in 2025, up from $205B at start of year
- Nearly $100B in new supply in under twelve months
- For context: supply increased by $70B across all of 2024, and actually decreased in 2023
- JP Morgan projects $500-750B; Citi projects $1.9T by 2030; Standard Chartered projects $2T by 2028

### The Current Playbook (and Its Limits)
The stablecoin growth story of 2025 has mostly been about taking what already exists in fintech and running it on better infrastructure — payments, yield, spending, cards. "Mercury but global. Revolut but onchain."

This works, but it's not the full picture.

### Self-Custody Changes the Risk Model
- Traditional banking: your "balance" is an IOU. The bank lends your deposits. FDIC insurance protects against the bank mismanaging your capital.
- Self-custodial stablecoin accounts: assets are in a smart contract, verifiable at any moment, under the user's control, with no counterparty risk from a bank's lending decisions.
- "When you can't see where the money is, you can't know if it's safe."
- Caveat: stablecoins themselves still carry issuer risk.

### The Real Opportunity
Stablecoin rails unlock something bigger than efficiency:
- Programmable money
- Access to internet capital markets with new financial primitives
- Agents managing funds with real guarantees (bounded by smart contract constraints)

He noted most teams aren't going after this yet.

### Challenges
- Security shortcuts being taken
- Privacy gaps for enterprise adoption
- The purpose-built blockchain debate

## Why It Works

- **The title is disarmingly casual** — "Random end of year shower musings" sets expectations low, which makes the depth of the piece a pleasant surprise. It reads as genuine thinking-out-loud rather than a polished thesis, which builds trust.
- **Bookmark-to-like ratio is exceptional** — 764 bookmarks on 697 likes (1.1x). This is reference material people are saving to revisit.
- **The "Mercury but global. Revolut but onchain." line** — Two comparisons that instantly communicate the current state of stablecoin fintech. This is the kind of shorthand that gets quoted and shared.
- **Acknowledges limits of his own thesis** — Noting that stablecoins carry issuer risk even in self-custody shows intellectual honesty. Readers trust writers who steelman the counterargument.
- **Visa executive co-sign** — Cuy Sheffield sharing it validates the piece to a broader audience and signals that institutional players are reading crypto-native analysis.
- **Contrasts the obvious with the non-obvious** — "Here's what everyone is building" (fintech on new rails) vs. "here's what almost no one is building yet" (programmable money, agent-managed funds). This gap is where the insight lives.

## Takeaways for Writing

- A casual, self-deprecating title ("shower musings") can outperform a polished one by lowering the reader's guard and signaling authenticity
- Comparing new things to known brands ("Mercury but global") is one of the fastest ways to communicate a concept
- Acknowledging counterarguments and limitations builds more credibility than pretending they don't exist
- End-of-year reflections are a natural content format — the calendar gives you a reason to step back and think big
- Identifying what most people are doing vs. what almost no one is doing yet is a reliable structure for insight pieces
- Getting shared by a known institutional figure (Cuy Sheffield / Visa) is a distribution multiplier — write for the smartest person in the room and let them amplify
