## Format

Long-form X article (research report). The tweet itself contains only the article link — no caption text. This is a comprehensive industry report, more in-depth than a typical X article. Collaborative effort with credited contributors.

## Core Thesis

Stablecoins have become the backbone of the crypto industry. With $300B market cap, 25.2M monthly senders, and $27T in annual transaction volume by September 2025, they are no longer a subsector — they are the sector.

## Structure Breakdown

The report follows a **market overview → taxonomy → deep dives → regulation → outlook** structure typical of institutional research:

1. **Market overview** — Scale and adoption metrics
2. **Stablecoin taxonomy** — Fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic, hybrid
3. **Individual stablecoin deep dives** — USDT, USDC, FRAX, cUSD, USDG, mUSD, fxUSD, crvUSD
4. **Stability mechanisms** — How different designs maintain their peg
5. **Yield mechanisms** — Treasury-based yields (4-5% typical)
6. **Regulatory frameworks** — GENIUS Act, MiCA, Singapore/Hong Kong standards
7. **Banking implications and risks**
8. **Institutional adoption trends**

## Key Data Points

- **$300 billion** — Global stablecoin market cap by September 2025 (all-time high)
- **25.2 million** — Monthly senders
- **$27 trillion** — Annual transaction volume
- **~$100 billion** — Payments settled between 2023 and mid-2025
- **500%** — MetaMask's mUSD supply surge since mid-September 2025 launch (~$100M circulating)
- **4-5%** — Typical Treasury-based yield on stablecoins

## Notable Stablecoin Profiles

### MetaMask's mUSD
First native stablecoin from the self-custodial wallet MetaMask. Issued by Stripe's Bridge with 1:1 backing in dollar-equivalent reserves (short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents). Supply surged 500% to ~$100M within weeks of launch.

### Curve's crvUSD
Uses LLAMMA (Liquidity-Linked Asset Management Mechanism) — an innovative AMM for soft liquidations that gradually sells collateral in Curve pools to prevent sharp depegs.

### f(x) Protocol's fxUSD
Employs "Liquidation Brake" — automated rebalancing that proactively adjusts leverage ratios by burning fxUSD from a stability pool or repaying debt via keepers, minimizing hard liquidation risks.

## Regulatory Landscape

### United States — GENIUS Act (signed July 18, 2025)
- Formally recognized stablecoins as payment instruments
- Mandates 1:1 reserves in high-quality assets
- Monthly attestations and audits required
- AML/KYC protocols enforced
- Prohibits uncollateralized algorithmic models
- Issuers must operate as chartered banks or trusts

### European Union — MiCA
- E-money institution licenses required
- Reserve segregation and transparency disclosures
- Daily volume caps: €200M for non-euro pegs, 1M transactions

## Why It Works

- **The title makes a bold claim** — "Crypto Is Now a Stablecoin Industry" is a declaration, not a question. It reframes the entire crypto narrative around one thesis.
- **Research report format builds authority** — This isn't an opinion piece. It's a data-heavy report with credited contributors and cross-platform publication (X + Medium). The format signals institutional-grade thinking.
- **Credited contributors** — Naming specific contributors (@081doteth, @stacy_muur, @dara_khan) adds credibility and expands distribution as each contributor shares with their audience.
- **Bookmark-to-like ratio is strong** — 157 bookmarks on 143 likes (1.1x). People are saving this as reference material at a rate that matches or exceeds liking. This is a research piece people return to.
- **Comprehensive taxonomy** — Covering fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic, and hybrid stablecoins positions this as a definitive guide rather than a partial view.
- **Regulatory detail is the differentiator** — Most crypto content avoids regulation or treats it superficially. This piece digs into the GENIUS Act and MiCA with specifics (reserve requirements, volume caps, licensing), which is exactly what institutional readers need.

## Takeaways for Writing

- Research reports work as X articles when the topic is timely and the data is fresh — this format is underused
- Crediting contributors by handle drives distribution and signals collaborative rigor
- A declarative title ("X is now Y") is stronger than a descriptive one ("The state of X") — it forces a reaction
- Bookmark-to-like ratios above 1.0 confirm you've written reference material
- Regulatory deep dives are a content moat — few people do them well, so when you do, the piece becomes the go-to resource
- Cross-publishing (X article + Medium) extends shelf life without diluting the original
- When covering an entire sector, a clear taxonomy (types, mechanisms, regulations) gives the piece structure that readers can navigate
