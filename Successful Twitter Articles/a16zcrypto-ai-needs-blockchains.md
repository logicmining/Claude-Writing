## Format

Long-form X article (link post). The tweet itself contains only the article link — no additional caption text. The article does the heavy lifting.

## Core Argument

AI systems are breaking an internet designed at human-scale by making it cheaper than ever to coordinate, transact, and generate voice, video, and text that are increasingly indistinguishable.

AI makes scale cheap but difficult to trust. Blockchains restore trust.

## Structure Breakdown

The article follows a clear **problem → framework → solutions** structure:

1. **Hook/Problem** — AI is destabilizing the internet's human-scale foundations
2. **Framing** — Five mechanisms where blockchains solve AI's trust gap
3. **Section-by-section breakdown** — Each mechanism gets its own section with specifics
4. **Conclusion** — Blockchains are not optional infrastructure

## The Five Mechanisms

### 1. Identity Scarcity
Proof-of-personhood systems make obtaining multiple identities prohibitively expensive, raising "the marginal cost of impersonation without raising friction for normal human behavior."

### 2. Decentralized Proof of Personhood
Users control their own identities rather than relying on centralized gatekeepers, preventing censorship and surveillance.

### 3. Portable Agent Passports
Blockchain-based identities enable AI agents to operate across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent, verifiable identity and capabilities.

### 4. Machine-Scale Payments
Cryptocurrency infrastructure enables micropayments and complex payment splits that traditional finance cannot handle.

### 5. Privacy-First Architecture
Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification of facts without revealing underlying data, making "privacy...the core defense."

## Why It Works

- **Strong thesis in the title** — "AI needs blockchains" is a bold, clear claim. "Especially now" adds urgency.
- **Specificity over vagueness** — Five concrete mechanisms, not abstract claims about "synergy" between AI and crypto.
- **Credible authors** — a16z crypto partners lend authority to the argument.
- **Quotable lines** — "AI makes scale cheap but difficult to trust. Blockchains restore trust." is concise and shareable.
- **Numbered framework** — Five distinct points make the argument easy to follow and reference.
- **No fluff** — Each section delivers a specific mechanism with reasoning, not filler.

## Takeaways for Writing

- A bold, clear title can carry a link post with zero caption text
- Numbered frameworks (5 reasons, 3 steps, etc.) give long-form articles a skeleton that keeps readers moving
- Pairing a broad claim with specific mechanisms builds credibility
- Quotable one-liners within the piece drive secondary sharing
