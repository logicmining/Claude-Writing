## Full Text

Dear VCs/Angels/Token Founders/Advisors,

it's me, your moral compass calling. I'm reaching out to see how you're doing. It's been a while since we last spoke. I know you've been busy, but think it's time we had a chat. It feels like you've distanced yourself from me. You still speak the same tropes as you once believed years ago, but I'm beginning to wonder whether you believe what you're saying.

I don't mean to question your faith in the value that crypto can provide, but I don't see that faith manifesting in your investment decisions. I'd love for you to dispel my apprehensions, but first I'd like to give you more context on why I've been feeling down lately.

When we first met in 2015, there were few of you and the passion was immense. The opportunity wasn't clear, nobody believed, but you did. You were early to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Coinbase, and a handful of other opportunities. There was a blind optimism for what could be, and you were willing to imagine a world where your thesis played out over the following 10-20 years.

While I wasn't particularly pleased by some of your investments during late 2017, I was happy to see your cohort grow further in the depths of the 2019 bear market. The design space was growing, and you continued to envision a better world birthed by blockchain technology. Smart contracts were showing initial signs of PMF with developers. DeFi was in its infancy with the launch of lending products like MakerDAO and Compound. Kyber, 0x, and Uniswap were paving the way for decentralized exchanges, and the market was starting to turn around. Many of you backed founders that believed in a better future and were actively attempting to deliver on it.

As Covid was in full swing, the fruit of your labor began to appear. DeFi summer and the following bull market made many of you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams. While I was happy that you were being shown the fruits of your labor, I sensed a darkness brewing within you.

The swiftness and magnitude of wealth creation had begun to cloud your view. While your personal net worths had gone up substantially, your asset base had as well. Given the rapid pace of growth in the usage of the technology and prices of tokens, it only made sense for you to increase the pace of deployment, and luckily you had a lot to deploy. There was a deluge of founders coming to market to address all the potential new business opportunities that blockchains could provide. The amount of opportunities became difficult to keep up with and rounds were filling quicker than before. It was exhilarating, but something continued to not sit right with you.

Liquid token prices were beyond what could ever make sense. Why did you need to complete significant diligence if the market was rewarding you for getting anything to market? You continued to raise and deploy money, but when Terra blew up and price fell back to earth, you lightened up on the gas and took a step back to reevaluate your priors.

While it was unfortunate to see your pnl decline, it felt needed and deserved. After FTX blew up, you were thoroughly scarred. Public sentiment towards crypto was at a local low and there was a dearth of talent coming to market. Raising was becoming increasingly difficult and you held onto your dry powder like it was your last penny. Perhaps you were becoming too scared to deploy capital, but it felt right at the time.

I held hope that we would make it through this together, although there was a growing faction amongst you that had other intentions. Perhaps it was the newly minted investors and founders that saw their peers get unjustifiably rich and wanted a piece, only to be disillusioned once they saw how the sausage was made. As morals began to degrade, the blind optimism I once saw turned to a growing cynicism. Some of you decided to leave for greener pastures, and others decided to change strategies to maximize profitability under the new regime.

Over the following 18 months, many of you funded projects with highly valued liquid comps, but questionable founder quality. There were fewer founders to back, and many of you looked insularly to founders that you had previously worked with, not bearing in mind how some of them had left their previous projects that they had been working on. You knew the game: bring the token to market, market it to retail, generate high TVPI to raise another fund or charge elevated management fees.

Perhaps these dark dynamics were always present in the underbelly of the markets, but there were never so many of you participating in it as today. While I don't think many of you were actively committing crimes, your willful ignorance / complicitness reflects poorly on your decisions.

While I appreciate you indulging me in my long-winded rant, I'll get straight to the point on why I wrote this: Tokens are broken and liquid markets are acutely aware of the negative dynamics that private market participants have brought upon them. The faster we can fix the problem, the better it is for everyone.

The natural market dynamics are for the existing set of liquid market participants (that private market participants rely on) to slowly exit the market by choice or circumstance. This is the only reasonable conclusion because it's the only way to end the feedback loop of the most nefarious part of our market: the token premium.

The token premium is equivalent to the apple in the garden of eden. As long as it exists, people will be tempted to consume. It attracts the most unethical talent capable of taking advantage of it, and can cloud the judgement of otherwise ethical stakeholders.

It's a foregone conclusion that the token market needs a restructuring and without it being done voluntarily, the buyers will leave and force one to occur.

There are two major potential long-term holders of tokens: retail and funds. Today, Private market participants make outsized returns at the expense of these buyers. That's not to say that end buyers can't make money, but the private market needs the public market to pay tribute in order to generate a return: it needs to mark up its investment, and then liquidate it to public market investors.

There are <200 liquid funds with a mandate to hold tokens, there are <100k active on-chain traders, and there's a potential large pool of retail capital sitting on exchanges.

Most liquid funds are performing poorly relative to their benchmarks and there are no net inflows coming to this cohort until they are able to generate outsized returns. In order for liquid funds to generate outsized returns, they need to buy a token, mark it up, then sell it on the market. These funds need to eat at the expense of others, who may not necessarily lose money...

The same thing is true for retail capital in liquid markets: they generally perform poorly and broad groups of society believe "crypto" has a negative connotation as a byproduct.

The takeaway that should become increasingly obvious is that for a market to function, everyone needs to eat. When one part of the market eats at the expense of others, their food becomes sparse, their population starts to die out, and an equilibrium is reached.

In order for venture investors and liquid investors to eat, a project needs to create sustainable economic value to justify a higher fair valuation. This is the missing ingredient of most of the soulless token machines being brought to market.

Private market participants will eventually find themselves launching tokens into a market with no bidder and be forced to play increasingly unethical games in order to salvage their outcomes until the space eats itself and no one wants to launch tokens because they don't make money.

Do you want the carrot or the stick?

Liquid markets are happy to keep calling private market participants out, finding ways to blacklist bad actors, start lawsuits, etc... and make it so that the cost and probability of punishment surmount the upside of committing crime.

Liquid markets would also happily accept the launch of tokenized venture equity vs. whatever it is being brought to market today. Perhaps this reduces the expected value of investing in private markets in the short-term as they can't "double dip", but I fail to see how it isn't in your best interest to improve the cap structures of the tokens being launched.

We need a market that allows founders to raise capital, for private markets investors to provide capital and realize profits, and for liquid investors to provide capital and realize profits. If any one of these things isn't able to occur, the dynamic that's forcing this outcome will eventually eat itself.

## Structure Breakdown

The article uses a **Personal Story + Lesson** structure disguised as an open letter:

1. **Hook** — "Dear VCs/Angels/Token Founders/Advisors, it's me, your moral compass calling"
2. **Historical narrative** — Walks through 2015 → 2017 → 2019 → DeFi Summer → Terra/FTX → present day
3. **The turn** — "I'll get straight to the point on why I wrote this"
4. **Core argument** — The token premium is broken, markets need restructuring
5. **Ecosystem analysis** — Who the buyers are, why they're leaving
6. **Ultimatum** — "Do you want the carrot or the stick?"
7. **Proposed solution** — Tokenized venture equity, better cap structures

---

## Why It Works

- **The open letter format is disarming** — Writing as "your moral compass" is a creative device that lets the author deliver harsh criticism without sounding combative. It's personal, not preachy.
- **Chronological narrative builds trust** — Walking through 2015 to present shows the author was there, lived it, and saw the gradual decay firsthand. This is earned credibility, not claimed.
- **The turn is perfectly placed** — After the long narrative setup, "I'll get straight to the point" hits hard. The reader has been emotionally primed by the story and is now ready for the argument.
- **Ecosystem thinking** — The food chain metaphor ("everyone needs to eat") makes a complex market structure argument intuitive and memorable.
- **Specific numbers ground the critique** — "<200 liquid funds", "<100k active on-chain traders" — these aren't vague complaints, they're market sizing.
- **Ends with a choice, not a lecture** — "Do you want the carrot or the stick?" gives the audience agency rather than just scolding them.
- **No buzzwords** — The piece critiques an industry full of jargon without using any. It reads like a real person talking, not a thought leader performing.

## Takeaways for Writing

- Open letters create instant tension and curiosity — who is this addressed to and why?
- Chronological narratives work for industry critiques because they show gradual decay rather than sudden judgment
- Delaying your main point with a well-told story makes the argument land harder when it arrives
- Metaphors (garden of eden, food chain) make abstract market dynamics concrete and shareable
- Ending with a binary choice ("carrot or stick") is more engaging than ending with a recommendation
- Long-form posts without any formatting tricks (no bold, no bullets, no headers) can work when the writing itself carries the reader — but the hook has to be strong enough to earn that trust
