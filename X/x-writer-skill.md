# X (Twitter) Writer Skill

Use this skill when writing X posts. This guide builds on the root copywriting skill and is based on successful long-form and short-form posts.

---

## Two Formats: Know Which You're Writing

### Short-Form Posts (Single tweet or brief thread)
- Hook + value + CTA
- Under 280 characters for the hook
- Gets to the point immediately
- Often announces something or shares a quick insight

### Long-Form Posts (Essays, guides, breakdowns)
- Deep dives on a single topic
- Structured with clear sections
- Teaches something specific and actionable
- Often 1,000-5,000+ words

## The Hook Is Everything

The first line determines whether anyone reads the rest. Study these patterns from successful posts:

### Pain Point Hook
Lead with a problem people feel:
> "Motion graphics were always the hardest part of making videos for me. Hours in After Effects for 10 seconds of movement."

### Contrarian/Surprising Hook
Challenge what people assume:
> "I'm a Carnegie Mellon trained engineer, but I still chose to use Lovable to build this."

### Scale/Numbers Hook
Concrete numbers grab attention:
> "I cut our spend by 98%."
> "216x difference. Same app. Same demo. Different hook."

### "Wait, what?" Hook
Create confusion that demands explanation:
> "how is this legal" = 10.2M views

### Bold Claim Hook
State something big, then back it up:
> "The Swarm Has Arrived"
> "We've been talking about agent swarms for years. This is the first time I've seen the architecture actually work in practice."

## Short-Form Structure

### The Announcement Post
```
[Pain point or context - 1-2 sentences]
[Solution or news - 1 sentence]
[What's in it / what you get - bullet list]
[Who it's for - 1 sentence]
[CTA - comment/DM/link]
```

Example:
> Motion graphics were always the hardest part...
> Now I can do them 10x faster...
> @Remotion released a skill...
> What's in the guide: [bullets]
> This is for content creators, marketers...
> Comment "GUIDE" and I'll DM you

### The Insight Post
```
[Observation or data point]
[Why it matters]
[What to do about it]
```

### The Breakdown Post
```
[Thing that happened / thing you noticed]
[The formula or pattern behind it]
[Specific numbers or proof]
[Takeaway]
```

Example (viral hook breakdown):
> same creator tested 4 hooks on same app:
> - "this AI builds apps" = 47k views
> - "I built an app in 10 minutes" = 89k views
> - "how is this legal" = 10.2M views
> **216x difference**. same app. same demo. different hook.

## Long-Form Structure

### The Guide/Tutorial
```
[Hook: problem you're solving]
[Credibility: why you can speak to this]
[Overview: what you'll cover]

[Section 1: Problem context]
[Section 2: Solution overview]
[Section 3-N: Step-by-step with specifics]

[Results/Numbers]
[Caveats/Edge cases]
[TL;DR]
[CTA]
```

### The Analysis/Breakdown
```
[Hook: what happened]
[Context: why it matters]
[The thing everyone gets wrong]
[How it actually works - with specifics]
[What this means]
[Where this is going]
[What to do about it]
```

### The Personal Story + Lesson
```
[Hook: situation or decision]
[Background: how you got here]
[What you did - with specifics]
[Results - with numbers]
[What you learned]
[What it means for the reader]
```

## Voice & Tone for X

### Be Direct
Cut the preamble. Get to it.

Bad: "I've been thinking a lot lately about how AI is changing the way we work, and I wanted to share some thoughts..."

Good: "AI is changing how we work. Here's what I'm seeing."

### Use Lowercase for Casual Authority
Notice how successful posts often drop capitalization for a more conversational feel:
> "the formula is **stupid simple**"
> "no explanation. no tutorial voice. just pure demo."

This works for insights and breakdowns. Use proper capitalization for professional/credibility pieces.

### Bold for Emphasis
Use **bold** to highlight key phrases readers should remember:
> "**216x difference**. same app. same demo. different hook."
> "the reason it works is the **implied illegality**"

### Short Paragraphs, Lots of Line Breaks
On X, white space = readability. One idea per line. Break often.

### Specificity = Credibility
Don't say "saved money" — say "cut spend by 98%"
Don't say "it took a while" — say "~15 hours across a weekend"
Don't say "it worked well" — say "37.8% membership qualification rate"

## CTAs That Work on X

### The Comment Trigger
> Comment "GUIDE" and I'll DM you the repo

### The Connection Ask
> (Make sure we're connected so I can DM you)

### The Link Drop
> Check it out: [link]

### The Soft Invite
> If you're building in this space, I'd love to hear from you. Reply to this.

## Formatting Best Practices

### For Readability
- Use line breaks liberally
- Bold key phrases
- Bullet lists for multiple items
- Code blocks for technical content (in long-form)

### For Engagement
- Ask questions that invite responses
- Leave some things unsaid (creates curiosity)
- End sections with implications, not just facts

### For Technical Content
- Show the prompt/code you used
- Include specific numbers and results
- Explain what you learned, not just what you did
- Acknowledge limitations and edge cases

## What to Avoid

From the root copywriting skill, plus X-specific issues:

- **Thread bait without substance** — Don't promise "10 things" then deliver fluff
- **Humble bragging** — Either brag or don't, but pick one
- **Vague promises** — "This changed everything" means nothing without specifics
- **Over-explaining** — X readers are smart; don't patronize
- **Repetitive parallel structure** — Avoid "No X. Just Y." patterns repeated multiple times (feels AI-generated)
- **Generic CTAs** — "Like and retweet" is weak; give them something specific to do
- **Burying the value** — Put the good stuff up top, not after 500 words of context
