# mUSD: The First Product From Minted's Blockchain Liquidity Engine

---

The stablecoin market just crossed $300B. Lending protocols manage billions. Tokenized Treasuries are the hottest narrative in crypto.

And yet — almost none of it works for institutions.

Not because the technology is broken. Because the infrastructure underneath it was never built for them.

That's what Minted is fixing. And mUSD is the proof.

## The Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

Here's the dirty secret of tokenized finance: **liquidity is fake**.

Not in the rug-pull sense. In the structural sense. The vast majority of tokenized assets — real estate, credit, Treasuries, private equity — sit on-chain with no reliable way to enter or exit a position at fair value.

You can mint a tokenized Treasury. You can put it in a smart contract. You can even call it "institutional grade." But if there's no continuous, transparent market for it — if the only way out is an OTC desk or waiting for a redemption window — you haven't created a liquid asset. You've created a PDF with a blockchain address.

This is the gap that separates crypto's $300B stablecoin market from the $500T+ in traditional financial assets that everyone says are "coming on-chain."

The rails exist. The liquidity doesn't.

## What Minted Actually Built

Minted's Blockchain Liquidity Engine (BLE) is not a stablecoin protocol. It's not a DEX. It's not a lending platform.

It's the infrastructure layer that makes all of those things work for institutional capital.

The BLE provides three things that don't exist together anywhere else in crypto:

**1. Continuous Liquidity**
Not AMM liquidity that gets drained. Not order book liquidity that disappears when you need it. The BLE creates persistent, programmatic liquidity for tokenized assets — meaning institutions can enter and exit positions without moving the market or waiting for a counterparty.

**2. Transparent Pricing**
Every asset priced through the BLE has real-time, auditable pricing derived from the underlying collateral. No oracle manipulation. No stale prices. No "trust us" attestations that update monthly.

**3. Institutional Compliance Built In**
This is the part most DeFi protocols skip entirely. The BLE operates on Canton Network — a blockchain designed from the ground up for regulated financial institutions. Privacy controls, permissioned access, and regulatory compliance aren't bolted on. They're architectural.

Think of the BLE as the market-making infrastructure for the tokenized economy. It doesn't issue the assets. It makes them tradeable.

## Why Canton Network

Most people in crypto have never heard of Canton. That's by design.

Canton is a Layer 1 built by Digital Asset (the company behind DAML, used by Goldman Sachs, ASX, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, among others). It was purpose-built for institutional finance — not adapted for it after the fact.

What makes Canton different from every other chain trying to attract TradFi:

- **Sub-transaction privacy** — Counterparties only see the data relevant to them. Not the entire ledger. This isn't a privacy feature — it's a legal requirement for institutional capital.
- **Interoperability by default** — Canton connects to other Canton-based applications without bridges. No wrapping. No cross-chain risk. Assets move between applications atomically.
- **Regulatory architecture** — The network was designed to comply with existing financial regulations, not to work around them.

Minted chose Canton because the BLE needs to operate at the intersection of DeFi composability and TradFi compliance. No other chain credibly offers both.

## mUSD: Where the BLE Meets the Market

mUSD is Minted's stablecoin. But calling it "just a stablecoin" misses the point.

mUSD is the **first product built on the Blockchain Liquidity Engine**. It's the proof of concept for how the BLE creates institutional-grade liquidity for tokenized assets — starting with the simplest and most important one: the dollar.

Here's how it works:

**Backing:** 1:1 reserves in short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents. Not algorithmic. Not fractional. Full reserves, fully auditable.

**Issuance and Redemption:** Institutions can mint and redeem mUSD directly through the BLE. The process is programmatic — no manual OTC calls, no 3-day settlement windows, no "we'll get back to you."

**Liquidity:** This is where the BLE matters. mUSD doesn't just sit in a wallet. The BLE provides continuous liquidity for mUSD across Canton-based applications — meaning institutions can deploy and withdraw capital without slippage or counterparty risk.

**Yield:** mUSD holders benefit from the underlying Treasury yield. The reserves work for you while the stablecoin functions as a medium of exchange.

**Compliance:** KYC/AML built into the issuance layer. Permissioned access. Regulatory reporting. Everything an institution needs to actually hold this on their books.

## Why This Matters Now

Three things are converging that make mUSD's timing critical:

### 1. The GENIUS Act Changed the Rules

The U.S. GENIUS Act (signed July 2025) formally recognized stablecoins as payment instruments. It mandates 1:1 reserves, monthly attestations, AML/KYC compliance, and bans uncollateralized algorithmic models. This isn't future regulation — it's current law.

mUSD was built for this regime. Most existing stablecoins are scrambling to adapt to it.

### 2. Institutions Need Yield, Not Just Stability

With Treasury yields at 4-5%, institutions aren't interested in a stablecoin that just sits there. They want a dollar-denominated, yield-bearing, liquid instrument that they can deploy in DeFi-like environments without touching DeFi-like risk.

mUSD on the BLE is exactly that. Treasury-backed yield. Institutional liquidity. Regulatory compliance. On infrastructure that doesn't require explaining to a compliance officer why you're using a pseudonymous AMM on Ethereum.

### 3. The $500T Tokenization Wave Needs Liquidity Infrastructure

Everyone from BlackRock to JPMorgan is tokenizing assets. But tokenization without liquidity is just a data format change. The BLE is designed to be the liquidity layer that makes tokenized assets actually functional as financial instruments.

mUSD is the first demonstration. Tokenized credit, real estate, and private equity are next.

---

## The Bigger Picture

Here's what most people miss about Minted:

mUSD isn't the business. **The BLE is the business.**

mUSD proves that the engine works. It demonstrates that Minted can create continuous, compliant, institutional-grade liquidity for a tokenized asset. Once that's proven with a stablecoin — the simplest tokenized asset — the same infrastructure extends to everything else.

Tokenized Treasuries. Tokenized credit. Tokenized real estate. Tokenized private equity. Every asset class that's "coming on-chain" will need what the BLE provides: a way to actually trade with real liquidity, fair pricing, and regulatory compliance.

The stablecoin market is $300B. The global financial asset market is north of $500T. The BLE isn't competing for a slice of the stablecoin market. It's building the liquidity infrastructure for the tokenized economy.

mUSD is just the opening move.

## What Comes Next

Minted is onboarding institutional clients through the BLE now. The client pipeline includes asset managers, fintech platforms, and traditional financial institutions looking for compliant on-chain liquidity.

If you're building in tokenized finance, managing institutional capital, or working on stablecoin infrastructure — this is worth paying attention to.

The tokenized economy doesn't need another stablecoin. It needs liquidity infrastructure that actually works for the capital that matters.

That's what Minted built. And mUSD is the first proof that it works.
